## Model Architecture üß†

### Hybrid Recognition Approach

We implement a hybrid approach using two specialized services:

1. **Handwriting Recognition Service**
   - Primary: Custom Handwriting API
   - Optimized for mathematical symbol recognition
   - Handles complex mathematical notation and symbols
   - Real-time stroke processing and path analysis
   - Support for LaTeX conversion and standardization

2. **Mathematical Computation Service**
   - Primary: Gemini 2.0 Flash
   - Advanced problem-solving capabilities
   - Step-by-step solution generation
   - Mathematical rule explanation
   - API key rotation for scalability

### Why This Architecture?

1. **Specialized Expertise**
   - Handwriting API focuses on accurate symbol recognition
   - Gemini handles complex mathematical reasoning along with symbol recognition
   - Better results than using a single model for both tasks

2. **Scalability**
   - API key rotation system for handling high traffic
   - Cooldown periods prevent rate limiting
   - Efficient error handling and recovery

3. **Reliability**
   - Fallback mechanisms between services
   - Robust error handling
   - Consistent performance under load

## Technical Implementation üíª

### Service Layer

```dart
class MixedHandwritingService extends AbstractMathService {
  late HandwritingApiService _handwritingService;
  late GeminiApiService _geminiService;
}
```

- Coordinates between recognition and solving services
- Handles initialization and error management
- Maintains state consistency

### Recognition Pipeline

1. Stroke Collection
2. Path Processing
3. Symbol Recognition
4. LaTeX Conversion
5. Expression Standardization

### Solution Generation

1. Expression Parsing
2. Mathematical Analysis
3. Step Generation
4. Rule Identification
5. Result Verification

## Setup Instructions üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (Latest stable version)
- Dart SDK (Latest stable version)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- API Keys (Handwriting API and Gemini)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mathscribble-ai.git
   cd mathscribble-ai
   ```

2. Create an environment configuration file (`lib/config/env_config.dart`):
   ```dart
   class EnvConfig {
     static const String handwritingApiToken = 'YOUR_HANDWRITING_API_TOKEN';
     static const List<String> geminiApiKeys = ['KEY1', 'KEY2', 'KEY3'];
   }
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
